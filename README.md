# pluggable-autocomplete README

Ever find yourself writing stringly typed values that you wish you could autocomplete from some other data source? Well now you can.

This plugin lets you write .js files that fetch data into your built in list of autocomplete symbols.

## Features

- Write custom data extractor and drop it into .pluggable-autocomplete in your workspace

- [Use custom data!](sample.gif)



## Requirements

Write yourself a plugin! Pro-tip - use the command pallette to run `Create Sample Pluggable Autocomplete` to init a sample plugin in your workspace.

## Extension Settings

No settings yet!
Maybe we could customize the plugin directory...?

## Known Issues

no known issues yet! Open an issue on github.com/...
security note; this invokes files in the
.pluggable-autocomplete folder, and as such they should
be write-protected once you finish writing your plugin

## Release Notes

Yay first release!

**Enjoy!**
